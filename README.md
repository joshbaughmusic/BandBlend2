Band Blend 2 is a full stack rebuild of my original front end only project, Band Blend. It is a social media platform tailored for musicians and bands. The platform facilitates connections among users, aiding in the search for potential members and collaborators. Users can create profiles, post content, comment, message each other, and engage with posts. The search feature allows users to find members based on location, instrument, genre, and more. There is also a fully fleshed out admin side of the app to allow for user and content moderation. 

Tech stack: React.js, MUI, C#, ASP.NET, EF Core, PostgreSQL
